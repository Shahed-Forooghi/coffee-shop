# Coffee-Shop mini project is my first project with tailwind . 
Hello . I am a Shahed and I hope you will take a look at this project of mine.
This project displays the header of a coffee shop site and I will try to complete it in the future.
This project is responsive for desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile.
I would be happy if you could tell me your opinion about this project.
